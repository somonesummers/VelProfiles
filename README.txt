This is the code base to accompany "CONSTRAINING ICE SHEET BASAL SLIDING 
AND HORIZONTAL VELOCITY PROFILES USING A STATIONARY PHASE SENSITIVE RADAR 
SOUNDER" By Paul T. Summers, Dustin M. Schroeder, Matthew R. Siegfried.

This repository has a main script for generating syntetic data and running 
the fitting scheme displayed in the paper (slopeVelocity.m). There is also 
a script for running a large batch of randomly generated cases (VS_BatchRunner.m).

fit*.m files are functions used in the fitting scheme. 

ViewData.m is used to display field aPRES data that was first processed using the
methods cited in the paper.
